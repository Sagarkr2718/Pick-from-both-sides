# Pick-from-both-sides
You are given an integer array A of size N.  You have to perform B operations. In one operation, you can remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array A.  Find and return the maximum possible sum of the elements that were removed after B operations.
NOTE: Suppose B = 4, and array A contains 10 elements, then

You can remove the first four elements or can remove the last four elements, or can remove 1 from front and 3 from the back, etc. You need to return the maximum possible sum of elements you can remove.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105

1 <= B <= N

-103 <= A[i] <= 103



Input Format
First argument is an integer array A.

Second argument is an integer B.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the maximum possible sum of elements you removed.
